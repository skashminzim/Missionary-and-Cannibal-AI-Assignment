# Missionary-and-Cannibal-AI-Assignment

Three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, but the missionaries present on the either side of the bank cannot be outnumbered by cannibals. The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board. The above problem can be solved by a graph search method.
