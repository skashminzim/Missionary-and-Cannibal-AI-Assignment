# Missionary-and-Cannibal-AI-Assignment
The missionaries and cannibals problem is a well-known problem in artificial intelligence. The problem can be stated as follow. Three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, but the missionaries present on the either side of the bank cannot be outnumbered by cannibals. The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board. The above problem can be solved by BFS.<br><br>
I built the problem **Missionaries and Cannibals** using programming
language Java and used the console window to show the output. The steps for
solving the problem was to represent object State, implementing the search
algorithm, generating the successors and to finalize the program and print the path.
